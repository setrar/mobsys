    "2. **GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol):** Used for transmitting user data and signaling messages on the GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) networks. It is also used in LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and 5G for packet-switched communication.\n",

    "4. **S1AP/NAS-EPS:** Represents the interaction between the S1 Application Protocol and NAS (Non-Access Stratum) protocol related to EPS (Evolved Packet System) in LTE and 5G networks. NAS manages signaling between the UE (User Equipment) and the EPC.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **E-RAB (E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearer):** An E-RAB represents a communication channel or bearer that is established between the UE (User Equipment) and the E-UTRAN (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network). It is used to facilitate the transmission of user data and signaling information between the UE and the EPC (Evolved Packet Core).\n",

    "\n",
    "When a user establishes a connection to a 5G or LTE network, one or more E-RABs are established to support the transmission of data for various services (e.g., voice, video, or data services). The establishment, modification, and release of E-RABs are managed through signaling procedures, and the E-RABs play a crucial role in providing the necessary connectivity and service quality for the user's communication needs."

    "\n",
    "3. **SMF (Session Management Function):** The SMF is responsible for managing session-related information and policies. It interacts with the AMF and other network elements. NGAP may be involved in procedures related to session management.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **UPF (User Plane Function):** The UPF handles user data forwarding and routing in the user plane. While NGAP is primarily a control plane protocol, it may interact with UPF for certain control-plane-related procedures.\n",

    "5. **AUSF (Authentication Server Function):** The AUSF is responsible for authentication and key generation functions. NGAP may be involved in procedures related to authentication and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **NSSF (Network Slice Selection Function):** The NSSF is responsible for selecting and managing network slices. NGAP may be used in procedures related to network slice management.\n",
    "\n",
    "These entities work together to establish and manage connections, handle mobility events, manage sessions, and ensure the overall operation of the 5G network. NGAP provides a standardized protocol for control-plane communication between gNB and various core network functions."
